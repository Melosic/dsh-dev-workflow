// creates a commit, check that commit against the workflow rules and route the
// findings through the approval prompt.
//
// This rides on `tools/pre-execute`, a waterfall gate that wraps every tool
// call. Two things shape the handler below: it must call `next()` first (so a
// gate that already denies the call is not second-guessed), and it must always
// settle — a tool call that throws inside the gate would surface as a tool
// failure rather than a finding.
